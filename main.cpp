-------------------- Project Detail
CPSC 323 Project Assignment 1        
Due dates: 3/8 11:59 pm
Live demo: By appointment between 03/09 to 03/14
The first assignment is to write a lexical analyzer (lexer).
You can build your entire lexer using a FSM, Or build using at least FSMs for identifier, 
integer and real (the rest can be written ad-hoc)  but YOU HAVE TO CONSTRUCT A FSM 
for this assignment otherwise, there will be a deduction of 2 points!
       
Note: In your documentation (design section), YOU MUST write the REs for Identifiers, 
Real and Integer, and also show the NFSM.
The Lexer
A major component of your assignment will be to write a procedure (Function) â€“ lexer (),  that 
returns a token when it is needed.  Your lexer()  should return a record, one field for the token 
and another field the actual "value" of the token (lexeme), i.e. the instance of a token.
Your main program should test the lexer i.e., your program should read a file containing 
the source code of Rat23S to generate tokens and write out the results to an output file.   
Make sure that you print both, the tokens and lexemes. 
Basically, your main program should work as follows
     while not finished (i.e. not end of the source file) do
          call the lexer for a token 
          print the token and lexeme
     endwhile
Do at least 3 test cases and make sure that you turn in proper documentation using the 
documentation template.
                                        A simple  test case                      
                          
                   Source code:            
                                        while  (fahr < upper)   a = 23.00
   
                   Output:
                    token                             lexeme
                   keyword                            while
                   separator                           (            
                   identifier                           fahr
                   operator                             <
                   identifier                           upper
                   separator                            )
                   identifier                           a
                   operator                             =
                   real                                    23.00
